Hello! I'm Ben.  I'm a computer science PhD student
at Yale University.  I'm interested in formal verification,
programming languages, operating systems and machine learning.

I graduated from Vanderbilt University in 2023 with a bachelors
in computer science and mathematics, with honors and highest honors
respectively.
